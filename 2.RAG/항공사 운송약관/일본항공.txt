(6)In case the sub-paragraph (4) (b) applies, in the event of delivery to a Passenger of a part but not all of his/her Checked Baggage or in the event of Damage with respect to a part but not all of such Baggage, JAL's liability with respect to the undelivered or the Damage portion shall be reduced proportionately on the basis of the weight of the Baggage, notwithstanding the value of any part of the Baggage or the contents thereof.
(7)JAL shall not be liable for any Damage with respect to a Passenger's Baggage caused by the contents thereof. A Passenger whose property causes Damage to another Passenger's Baggage or the property of JAL shall indemnify JAL for all loss and expenses incurred by JAL as a result thereof.
(8)JAL shall not be liable for any Damage to items which are included in a Passenger's Checked Baggage, if and to the extent that the damage resulted from the inherent defect, quality or vice of the item, irrespective of JAL's knowledge thereof.
(9)JAL may refuse to accept any article which shall not constitute Baggage under these Conditions of Carriage; provided that, if the article is delivered to and received by JAL, it shall be subject to the Baggage valuation and limitation of liability set forth in these Conditions of Carriage and shall be subject to the rates and charges published by JAL.
(10)JAL will issue a Ticket or accepts Checked Baggage for Carriage performed by any other Carrier only as an agent of such Carrier. JAL shall not be liable for any Damage which shall have occurred outside a sector the Carriage for which shall have been performed by JAL. JAL shall neither be liable for any Damage which shall have occurred to Checked Baggage outside a sector the Carriage for which shall have been performed by JAL, except where the Passenger shall be entitled by the Convention to claim such Damage against JAL in case JAL is the first or the last Carrier under the relevant contract of Carriage.
(11)JAL shall not be liable in any event for any consequential or special damage or punitive damages arising from Carriage complying with these Conditions of Carriage and JAL's Regulations, whether or not JAL had knowledge that such damage might arise.
(12)Unless otherwise provided in these Conditions of Carriage, JAL reserves any and all right of defense available under the Convention. JAL also reserves a right to make a subrogation claim against a third party which shall have contributed to Damage, with respect to a portion or all of any payment made by JAL in connection with the Damage.
(13)Any exclusion or limitation of liability of JAL under these Conditions of Carriage and JAL's Regulations shall also apply to any of JAL's representatives, officers, employees or agents performing their respective duties and to any person or entity whose aircraft is used by JAL for Carriage and any of its representatives, officers, employees or agents performing their respective duties. The aggregate amount of the damages payable by JAL or its representatives, officers, employees or agents shall not exceed the amount of JAL's limitation of liability under these Conditions of Carriage.
19. TIME LIMITATIONS ON CLAIMS AND ACTIONS
(A) Time Limitation on Claims
No claim for damage may be made in the case of damage to Baggage, unless the person entitled to delivery complains to an office of JAL forthwith after the discovery thereof and no later than 7 Days from the date of receipt; and, in the case of delay or loss, unless the complaint is made no later than 21 Days from the date on which the Baggage has been (in the case of delay) or should have been (in the case of loss) placed at his/her disposal. Every complaint must be in writing and dispatched within the time aforesaid. In case Carriage is not "International Carriage" as defined in the Convention, failure to give such notice of complaint shall not prevent a claimant's filing a suit if the claimant proves that:
(1)it was not reasonably possible for him/her to give such notice;
(2) such notice was not given due to fraud on the part of JAL; or
(3) JAL had knowledge of the damage to the Passenger's Baggage.
(B) Time Limitation on Actions
Any right to damages against JAL shall be extinguished unless an action is brought within 2 years reckoned from the date of arrival at the Destination, from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived, or from the date on which the Carriage stopped.
20. OVERRIDING LAW
Any provision contained or referred to in a Ticket or in these Conditions of Carriage or JAL's Regulations shall, even if it is in violation of Applicable Laws and is invalid, remain valid to the extent not in conflict with Applicable Laws. The invalidity of any provision shall not affect any other provision.

21. MODIFICATION AND WAIVER
No representative, officer, employee or agent of JAL shall have authority to alter, modify or waive any provision of the contract of Carriage or of these Conditions of Carriage or JAL's Regulations.
